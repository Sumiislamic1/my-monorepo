# AI Symptom Checker

A monorepo web application that predicts possible diseases based on user-entered symptoms using a rule-based AI service. The user selects or types symptoms in the browser, the backend forwards them to the AI service, and results are returned with confidence scores, matched symptoms, and severity indicators.

| GET    | `/diseases` | List all diseases and symptoms       |
| POST   | `/predict`  | Predict diseases from symptoms       |

**POST `/predict` Request:**
```json
{ "symptoms": ["fever", "chills", "headache"] }
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "disease": "Malaria",
      "confidence": 60.0,
      "matched_symptoms": ["fever", "chills", "headache"],
      "total_symptoms": 5
    }
  ],
  "symptoms_checked": ["fever", "chills", "headache"]
}
```
